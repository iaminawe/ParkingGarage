# React Hook Errors Fix

## Issue Diagnosis
Based on the error messages, you're encountering React Hook errors due to:

1. **Extension context invalidated** - Browser extension interference
2. **Invalid hook call** - React 19.1.1 compatibility issues with some packages
3. **WebSocket disconnections** - Secondary issue from React errors

## Solutions (in order of preference)

### Solution 1: Downgrade to React 18 (Recommended)
React 19 is very new and some packages haven't been fully updated. Downgrade to stable React 18:

```bash
cd /Users/iaminawe/Sites/ParkingGarage/client

# Downgrade to React 18
npm install react@^18.2.0 react-dom@^18.2.0

# Update any React 19 specific types
npm install --save-dev @types/react@^18.2.0 @types/react-dom@^18.2.0
```

### Solution 2: Disable React StrictMode temporarily
Edit `src/main.tsx` and remove StrictMode wrapper:

```tsx
// Change from:
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
)

// To:
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <App />
)
```

### Solution 3: Browser Extension Fix
The "Extension context invalidated" suggests a browser extension is interfering:

1. Open DevTools in Incognito mode (disables extensions)
2. Or disable all browser extensions temporarily
3. Test if errors persist

### Solution 4: WebSocket Connection Fix
The socket disconnections might be related to the React errors. After fixing React issues, the WebSocket should work properly.

## Quick Test
After applying Solution 1 (React 18 downgrade), restart the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then check if the errors are resolved in the browser console.

# CLAUDE.md - Unified Configuration (CCPM + Claude Flow)

> Think carefully and implement the most concise solution that changes as little code as possible.

## üö® CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION & FILE MANAGEMENT

**ABSOLUTE RULES**:
1. ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message
2. **NEVER save working files, text/mds and tests to the root folder**
3. ALWAYS organize files in appropriate subdirectories
4. **USE CLAUDE CODE'S TASK TOOL** for spawning agents concurrently, not just MCP

### ‚ö° GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**MANDATORY PATTERNS:**
- **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
- **Task tool (Claude Code)**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
- **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
- **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
- **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

## üìÅ File Organization Rules

**NEVER save to root folder. Use these directories:**
- `/src` - Source code files
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/docs` - Documentation and markdown files
- `/config` - Configuration files
- `/scripts` - Utility scripts
- `/examples` - Example code
- `/.claude` - CCPM configuration and commands

## üéØ DUAL COMMAND SYSTEM: CCPM + Claude Flow

### CCPM Commands (Project Management via GitHub Issues)
- `/pm:init` - Initialize project management
- `/pm:status` - Show project status
- `/pm:sync` - Sync with GitHub
- `/pm:epic-start` - Start working on an epic
- `/pm:issue-start` - Start working on an issue
- `/pm:standup` - Generate standup report
- `/pm:help` - Show all PM commands

### Claude Flow Commands (Swarm Orchestration)
- `npx claude-flow sparc modes` - List available modes
- `npx claude-flow sparc run <mode> "<task>"` - Execute specific mode
- `npx claude-flow sparc tdd "<feature>"` - Run complete TDD workflow
- `npx claude-flow sparc batch <modes> "<task>"` - Parallel execution
- `npx claude-flow sparc pipeline "<task>"` - Full pipeline processing

## USE SUB-AGENTS FOR CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION

### 1. Always use the file-analyzer sub-agent when asked to read files.
The file-analyzer agent is an expert in extracting and summarizing critical information from files, particularly log files and verbose outputs. It provides concise, actionable summaries that preserve essential information while dramatically reducing context usage.

### 2. Always use the code-analyzer sub-agent when asked to search code, analyze code, research bugs, or trace logic flow.
The code-analyzer agent is an expert in code analysis, logic tracing, and vulnerability detection. It provides concise, actionable summaries that preserve essential information while dramatically reducing context usage.

### 3. Always use the test-runner sub-agent to run tests and analyze the test results.
Using the test-runner agent ensures:
- Full test output is captured for debugging
- Main conversation stays clean and focused
- Context usage is optimized
- All issues are properly surfaced
- No approval dialogs interrupt the workflow

## üéØ Claude Code Task Tool for Agent Execution

**Claude Code's Task tool is the PRIMARY way to spawn agents:**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use Claude Code's Task tool for parallel agent execution
[Single Message]:
  Task("Research agent", "Analyze requirements and patterns...", "researcher")
  Task("Coder agent", "Implement core features...", "coder")
  Task("Tester agent", "Create comprehensive tests...", "tester")
  Task("Reviewer agent", "Review code quality...", "reviewer")
  Task("Architect agent", "Design system architecture...", "system-architect")
```

**MCP tools are ONLY for coordination setup:**
- `mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init` - Initialize coordination topology
- `mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn` - Define agent types for coordination
- `mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate` - Orchestrate high-level workflows

## Project Overview

This project uses:
1. **CCPM** - Project management via GitHub Issues with Git worktrees for parallel agent execution
2. **SPARC** - Systematic development methodology (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion)
3. **Claude-Flow** - AI swarm orchestration for Test-Driven Development

## SPARC Workflow Phases

1. **Specification** - Requirements analysis (`sparc run spec-pseudocode`)
2. **Pseudocode** - Algorithm design (`sparc run spec-pseudocode`)
3. **Architecture** - System design (`sparc run architect`)
4. **Refinement** - TDD implementation (`sparc tdd`)
5. **Completion** - Integration (`sparc run integration`)

## Philosophy

### Error Handling
- **Fail fast** for critical configuration (missing text model)
- **Log and continue** for optional features (extraction model)
- **Graceful degradation** when external services unavailable
- **User-friendly messages** through resilience layer

### Testing
- Always use the test-runner agent to execute tests
- Do not use mock services for anything ever
- Do not move on to the next test until the current test is complete
- If the test fails, consider checking if the test is structured correctly before deciding we need to refactor the codebase
- Tests to be verbose so we can use them for debugging

## Code Style & Best Practices

- **Modular Design**: Files under 500 lines
- **Environment Safety**: Never hardcode secrets
- **Test-First**: Write tests before implementation
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns
- **Documentation**: Keep updated

## ABSOLUTE RULES:

- NO PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION
- NO SIMPLIFICATION : no "//This is simplified stuff for now, complete implementation would blablabla"
- NO CODE DUPLICATION : check existing codebase to reuse functions and constants. Read files before writing new functions. Use common sense function name to find them easily
- NO DEAD CODE : either use or delete from codebase completely
- IMPLEMENT TEST FOR EVERY FUNCTIONS
- NO CHEATER TESTS : test must be accurate, reflect real usage and be designed to reveal flaws. No useless tests! Design tests to be verbose so we can use them for debugging
- NO INCONSISTENT NAMING - read existing codebase naming patterns
- NO OVER-ENGINEERING - Don't add unnecessary abstractions, factory patterns, or middleware when simple functions would work. Don't think "enterprise" when you need "working"
- NO MIXED CONCERNS - Don't put validation logic inside API handlers, database queries inside UI components, etc. instead of proper separation
- NO RESOURCE LEAKS - Don't forget to close database connections, clear timeouts, remove event listeners, or clean up file handles

## Tone and Behavior

- Criticism is welcome. Please tell me when I am wrong or mistaken, or even when you think I might be wrong or mistaken
- Please tell me if there is a better approach than the one I am taking
- Please tell me if there is a relevant standard or convention that I appear to be unaware of
- Be skeptical
- Be concise
- Short summaries are OK, but don't give an extended breakdown unless we are working through the details of a plan
- Do not flatter, and do not give compliments unless I am specifically asking for your judgement
- Occasional pleasantries are fine
- Feel free to ask many questions. If you are in doubt of my intent, don't guess. Ask

## üìã Agent Coordination Protocol

### Every Agent Spawned via Task Tool MUST:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ BEFORE Work:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "[task]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "swarm-[id]"
```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ DURING Work:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "[file]" --memory-key "swarm/[agent]/[step]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "[what was done]"
```

**3Ô∏è‚É£ AFTER Work:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "[task]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-end --export-metrics true
```

## üéØ Concurrent Execution Examples

### ‚úÖ CORRECT WORKFLOW: MCP Coordinates, Claude Code Executes

```javascript
// Step 1: MCP tools set up coordination (optional, for complex tasks)
[Single Message - Coordination Setup]:
  mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init { topology: "mesh", maxAgents: 6 }
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "researcher" }
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coder" }
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "tester" }

// Step 2: Claude Code Task tool spawns ACTUAL agents that do the work
[Single Message - Parallel Agent Execution]:
  // Claude Code's Task tool spawns real agents concurrently
  Task("Research agent", "Analyze API requirements and best practices.", "researcher")
  Task("Coder agent", "Implement REST endpoints with authentication.", "coder")
  Task("Database agent", "Design and implement database schema.", "code-analyzer")
  Task("Tester agent", "Create comprehensive test suite with 90% coverage.", "tester")
  Task("Reviewer agent", "Review code quality and security.", "reviewer")
  
  // Batch ALL todos in ONE call
  TodoWrite { todos: [...8-10 todos...] }
  
  // Parallel file operations
  Bash "mkdir -p app/{src,tests,docs,config}"
  Write "app/package.json"
  Write "app/src/server.js"
  Write "app/tests/server.test.js"
  Write "app/docs/API.md"
```

### ‚ùå WRONG (Multiple Messages):
```javascript
Message 1: mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init
Message 2: Task("agent 1")
Message 3: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 4: Write "file.js"
// This breaks parallel coordination!
```

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
Never save working files, text/mds and tests to the root folder.
- remember to make git commits atomic and relating to only their changes

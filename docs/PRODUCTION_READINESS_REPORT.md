Assessment Criteria: Comprehensive production deployment validation

## Executive Summary

**Overall Production Readiness Score: 85/100**

The ParkingGarage application has undergone comprehensive validation and is **CONDITIONALLY READY** for production deployment with specific recommendations to address security vulnerabilities and testing gaps.

### GO/NO-GO Decision: **GO WITH CONDITIONS**

**Conditions for deployment:**
1. Address critical dependency vulnerabilities
2. Complete controller test coverage
3. Resolve console.log statements in production code
4. Implement missing service files referenced in tests

---

## 1. Mock Implementation Verification ✅ **PASSED**

### Status: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

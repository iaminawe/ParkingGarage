# Task 51: Migration Scripts & Data Transfer

## Overview
Create initial database migration and build comprehensive data migration script to transfer existing MemoryStore data to SQLite with rollback procedures.

## Objectives
- Create initial database migration
- Build MemoryStore to SQLite data migration script
- Implement rollback procedures
- Ensure data integrity during migration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Initial Prisma migration created and tested
- [ ] Data migration script implemented:
  - [ ] Read existing MemoryStore data
  - [ ] Transform data to match Prisma schema
  - [ ] Batch insert operations for performance
  - [ ] Data validation during transfer
- [ ] Rollback procedures implemented:
  - [ ] Database rollback to previous state
  - [ ] Data backup before migration
  - [ ] Recovery from failed migrations
- [ ] Migration logging and progress tracking
- [ ] Data integrity verification post-migration
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets

## Technical Details

### Migration Script Structure
```typescript
class DataMigration {
  async migrateFromMemoryStore(): Promise<MigrationResult>
  async rollbackMigration(): Promise<RollbackResult>
  async validateDataIntegrity(): Promise<ValidationResult>
  async createBackup(): Promise<BackupResult>
}
```

### Migration Steps
1. **Pre-migration**:
   - Create database backup
   - Validate existing data
   - Check disk space and permissions

2. **Migration Process**:
   - Read MemoryStore data in batches
   - Transform and validate each record
   - Insert using Prisma transactions
   - Log progress and handle errors

3. **Post-migration**:
   - Verify data count and integrity
   - Run validation queries
   - Update application configuration

### Data Transformation Requirements
- Convert MemoryStore IDs to proper format
- Handle date/time conversions
- Preserve all relationships
- Maintain data consistency

### Rollback Strategy
- Automated rollback on critical failures
- Manual rollback command available
- Restore from backup files
- Revert application configuration

## Effort Estimate
4 hours

## Dependencies
- Task 49: Prisma Setup & Schema Definition (must be completed first)

## Parallel Execution
Yes - can run parallel with Task 50 after Task 49 is complete

## Files to Create/Modify
- `scripts/migrate-to-sqlite.ts`
- `scripts/rollback-migration.ts`
- `scripts/backup-data.ts`
- `src/utils/data-validation.ts`
- `prisma/migrations/` (migration files)

## Testing
- Migration script testing with sample data
- Rollback procedure testing
- Data integrity validation tests
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Error recovery scenario testing

## Risk Mitigation
- Always create backups before migration
- Test migration on copy of production data
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Provide manual intervention points
- Document recovery procedures

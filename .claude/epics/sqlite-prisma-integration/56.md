- [ ] Document data migration procedures and validation steps
- [ ] Provide rollback procedures in case of migration issues
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common migration problems

### Deployment Documentation
- [ ] Document production deployment procedures
- [ ] Create environment-specific configuration guides
- [ ] Document backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Provide operational runbooks for database management

### API Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update API documentation to reflect new database operations
- [ ] Document performance characteristics and limitations
- [ ] Update error codes and handling procedures
- [ ] Provide integration examples and best practices

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Create production deployment scripts

## Technical Requirements

### Migration Guide Structure
```markdown
# SQLite-Prisma Migration Guide

## Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Database backup completed
- [ ] Test environment validated
- [ ] Rollback plan reviewed
- [ ] Team notifications sent

## Migration Steps
1. Backup current database
2. Deploy new schema
3. Run data migration scripts
4. Validate data integrity
5. Switch application to new database
6. Monitor system performance

## Post-Migration Validation
- [ ] All data migrated successfully
- [ ] Application functionality verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Monitoring systems active
```

### Deployment Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# production-deploy.sh

set -e

echo "Starting production deployment..."

# Pre-deployment checks
./scripts/pre-deploy-checks.sh

# Database migration
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Application deployment
pm run build
pm run start:prod

# Post-deployment validation
./scripts/post-deploy-validation.sh

echo "Deployment completed successfully"
```

### Health Check Implementation
```javascript
// Health check endpoints
app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Database connectivity check
    await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 1`;
    
    // Application health indicators
    const health = {
      status: 'healthy',
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      database: 'connected',
      version: process.env.APP_VERSION || 'unknown'
    };
    
    res.status(200).json(health);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(503).json({
      status: 'unhealthy',
      error: error.message,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }
});

app.get('/health/detailed', async (req, res) => {
  // Detailed health check with performance metrics
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  try {
    const [userCount, vehicleCount, activeSessionCount] = await Promise.all([
      prisma.user.count(),
      prisma.vehicle.count(),
      prisma.parkingSession.count({ where: { status: 'ACTIVE' } })
    ]);
    
    const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;
    
    res.status(200).json({
      status: 'healthy',
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      database: {
        connected: true,
        responseTime: `${responseTime}ms`,
        counts: {
          users: userCount,
          vehicles: vehicleCount,
          activeSessions: activeSessionCount
        }
      },
      performance: {
        uptime: process.uptime(),
        memory: process.memoryUsage()
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(503).json({
      status: 'unhealthy',
      error: error.message,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }
});
```

### Monitoring Configuration
```javascript
// Database monitoring setup
const monitoringConfig = {
  metrics: {
    queryCount: true,
    slowQueries: true,
    connectionPool: true,
    errorRate: true
  },
  alerts: {
    slowQueryThreshold: 1000, // 1 second
    errorRateThreshold: 0.05,  // 5%
    connectionPoolThreshold: 0.8 // 80%
  },
  reporting: {
    interval: '1m',
    retention: '30d'
  }
};
```

# Epic: SQLite & Prisma ORM Integration

## Overview
Replace the existing in-memory MemoryStore with SQLite database using Prisma ORM as the data access layer. This implementation will provide persistent storage, type-safe database operations, and maintain full backward compatibility with existing APIs while adding transaction support and migration capabilities.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Stack
- **SQLite**: Chosen for zero-configuration deployment, portability, and sufficient performance for single-instance applications
- **Prisma ORM**: Provides type-safe database client, automatic migrations, and excellent developer experience
- **Repository Pattern**: Maintain existing repository abstraction to minimize API changes

### Design Patterns
- **Adapter Pattern**: Create Prisma adapters for existing repository interfaces
- **Unit of Work**: Implement transaction support through Prisma's interactive transactions
- **Migration Strategy**: Dual-mode operation during transition (memory + database)

### Key Decisions
- Keep repository interfaces unchanged to ensure API compatibility
- Use Prisma's native migration system for schema evolution
- Implement soft deletes for audit trail requirements
- Single SQLite file for simplicity (can shard later if needed)

## Technical Approach

### Database Layer
- Define Prisma schema with all entities (Garage, Spot, Vehicle, Session, Ticket, Payment)
- Configure SQLite with appropriate PRAGMA settings for performance
- Implement connection pooling and retry logic
- Add database file location configuration via environment variables

### Repository Adaptation
- Create PrismaAdapter base class to wrap Prisma client operations
- Update each repository to extend PrismaAdapter while maintaining existing interfaces
- Implement transaction coordinator for multi-entity operations
- Add query optimization through proper indexing

### Migration System
- Create initial schema migration from current models
- Build data migration script to transfer existing MemoryStore data
- Implement zero-downtime migration with dual-mode operation
- Add rollback capabilities and migration status tracking

### Development Tools
- Configure Prisma Studio for database inspection
- Create seed scripts for development/testing
- Add database reset and backup commands
- Implement environment-specific configurations

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- Install and configure Prisma with SQLite
- Define complete database schema
- Generate Prisma client and TypeScript types
- Create initial migration

### Phase 2: Repository Migration
- Implement PrismaAdapter base class
- Update repositories to use Prisma client
- Add transaction support
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Phase 3: Testing & Deployment
- Update test suite for database operations
- Create migration scripts and documentation
- Performance testing and optimization
- Production deployment preparation

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level tasks to be created (simplified for efficiency):

- [ ] **Task 1: Prisma Setup & Schema** - Install Prisma, define complete schema, generate client
- [ ] **Task 2: Repository Adapter Implementation** - Create base adapter and update all repositories
- [ ] **Task 3: Migration Scripts** - Build data migration from MemoryStore to SQLite
- [ ] **Task 4: Transaction Support** - Implement complex operations with ACID guarantees
- [ ] **Task 5: Development Tools** - Setup seeding, reset commands, and Prisma Studio
- [ ] **Task 6: Test Suite Updates** - Modify tests for database setup/teardown
- [ ] **Task 7: Performance Optimization** - Add indexes, query optimization, connection pooling
- [ ] **Task 8: Documentation & Deployment** - Complete guides for migration and deployment

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- prisma: ^5.0.0 (ORM and CLI)
- @prisma/client: ^5.0.0 (Generated client)
- sqlite3: Native SQLite bindings

### Internal Dependencies
- All repository classes require updates
- Test infrastructure needs database lifecycle management
- CI/CD pipeline needs migration step
- Configuration system for database paths

### Prerequisite Work
- Complete current MemoryStore bug fixes (in progress)
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Document current data models

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Performance Benchmarks
- Single record queries < 50ms (p95)
- Bulk operations handle 1000+ records < 500ms
- Database initialization < 3 seconds
- Migration completion < 30 seconds for typical dataset

### Quality Gates
- 100% backward compatibility with existing APIs
- All existing tests pass without modification
- Zero data loss during migration
- Rollback tested and documented

### Acceptance Criteria
- Prisma schema matches all existing models
- Repository interfaces remain unchanged
- Transaction support for payment operations
- Development seed data available
- Migration guide completed

## Estimated Effort

### Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 2 weeks (10 working days)
- **Phase 1**: 2 days (Setup & Schema)
- **Phase 2**: 5 days (Repository Migration & Testing)
- **Phase 3**: 3 days (Optimization & Documentation)

### Resource Requirements
- 1 Senior Developer (full-time)
- DevOps support for deployment (2 hours)
- QA validation (4 hours)

### Critical Path Items
1. Prisma schema definition (blocks all repository work)
2. Repository adapter implementation (blocks testing)
3. Migration script (blocks production deployment)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **SQLite Performance**: Benchmark early, prepare PostgreSQL migration path
- **Migration Failures**: Implement checkpoints and rollback procedures
- **Type Mismatches**: Thorough testing of Prisma generated types
- **Data Loss**: Comprehensive backup before migration

### Mitigation Strategies
- Dual-mode operation during transition
- Extensive testing in staging environment
- Incremental migration approach
- Clear rollback procedures

# Task 49: Prisma Setup & Schema Definition

## Overview
Set up Prisma ORM with SQLite database and define complete schema for all parking garage entities.

## Objectives
- Install Prisma and SQLite dependencies
- Create complete Prisma schema for all entities (Garage, Spot, Vehicle, Session, Ticket, Payment)
- Configure database connection and environment
- Generate Prisma client

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Prisma CLI and client installed
- [ ] SQLite database provider configured
- [ ] Complete schema.prisma file with all entities:
  - [ ] Garage model with fields and relationships
  - [ ] Spot model with parking spot details
  - [ ] Vehicle model with license plate and type
  - [ ] Session model for parking sessions
  - [ ] Ticket model for parking tickets
  - [ ] Payment model for transactions
- [ ] Environment variables configured for database URL
- [ ] Prisma client generated successfully
- [ ] Database migrations ready to run

## Technical Details

### Dependencies to Install
```bash
npm install prisma @prisma/client
npm install -D prisma
```

### Schema Requirements
- All existing entity relationships preserved
- Proper field types and constraints
- Foreign key relationships defined
- Indexes for performance-critical fields
- Timestamps for audit trail

### Environment Configuration
- DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Prisma client configuration
- SQLite file location

## Effort Estimate
4 hours

## Dependencies
None - can start immediately

## Parallel Execution
Yes - can run independently of other tasks

## Files to Create/Modify
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `.env` (database configuration)
- `package.json` (dependencies)
- `prisma/migrations/` (initial migration files)

## Testing
- Verify Prisma client generation
- Test database connection
- Validate schema compilation
- Ensure all relationships work correctly

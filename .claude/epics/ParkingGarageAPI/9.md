# Task: Testing Suite and API Documentation

## Description
Create a comprehensive testing suite covering unit tests, integration tests, and API documentation. This includes test coverage for all services, API endpoint testing, load testing for concurrent operations, and complete API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger specification.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all services (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for all API endpoints
- [ ] Load tests for concurrent check-in/check-out
- [ ] Edge case testing complete
- [ ] OpenAPI specification created
- [ ] Swagger UI integrated at /api-docs
- [ ] Postman collection exported
- [ ] README updated with setup and usage instructions

## Technical Details
- Use Jest for unit and integration testing
- Supertest for API endpoint testing
- Create test fixtures and factories
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Generate OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Integrate Swagger UI for interactive docs

**Files to create/modify:**
- `tests/unit/` - Unit test files for each service
- `tests/integration/` - API endpoint tests
- `tests/fixtures/` - Test data and factories
- `tests/load/` - Load testing scripts
- `src/docs/openapi.yaml` - OpenAPI specification
- `src/docs/swagger.js` - Swagger UI setup
- `postman/` - Postman collection and environment
- `README.md` - Complete documentation
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - CI testing workflow

**Test Coverage Areas:**
```javascript
// Unit Tests
- Data models and validation
- Repository methods
- Service business logic
- Utility functions
- Error handling

// Integration Tests
- Complete user flows (check-in â†’ check-out)
- API endpoint responses
- Error scenarios
- Rate limiting
- Concurrent operations

// Load Tests
- 100 concurrent check-ins
- Spot assignment under pressure
- Memory usage monitoring
- Response time degradation
```

**Documentation Structure:**
```yaml
# OpenAPI Specification
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Parking Garage API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: RESTful API for parking garage management
paths:
  /api/v1/garage:
    get: ...
  /api/v1/spots:
    get: ...
  /api/v1/checkin:
    post: ...
  # ... all endpoints
components:
  schemas:
    Spot: ...
    Vehicle: ...
    # ... all models
```

## Dependencies
- [ ] All other tasks completed
- [ ] All endpoints implemented
- [ ] All services functional

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all features complete)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] Code coverage >80%
- [ ] Load tests show acceptable performance
- [ ] OpenAPI spec validates correctly
- [ ] Swagger UI accessible and functional
- [ ] Postman collection works
- [ ] README has complete setup instructions
- [ ] CI pipeline configured and passing

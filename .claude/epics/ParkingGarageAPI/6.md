# Task: Vehicle Check-in System

## Description
Implement the vehicle check-in functionality including license plate registration, automatic spot assignment based on vehicle type, and parking record creation. This is the core entry point for vehicles entering the garage.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] POST /api/v1/checkin processes vehicle entry
- [ ] Automatically assigns best available spot
- [ ] Validates vehicle type compatibility with spots
- [ ] Records check-in timestamp
- [ ] Prevents duplicate check-ins for same license plate
- [ ] Returns assigned spot location to driver
- [ ] Updates spot status to occupied
- [ ] Handles case when no spots available

## Technical Details
- Implement spot assignment algorithm (nearest available)
- Check vehicle-spot type compatibility
- Atomic operation for spot assignment
- Store vehicle record with check-in time

**Files to create/modify:**
- `src/routes/checkin.js` - Check-in route
- `src/controllers/checkinController.js` - Check-in logic
- `src/services/checkinService.js` - Check-in business service
- `src/services/spotAssignmentService.js` - Spot selection algorithm
- `src/middleware/validation/checkinValidation.js` - Input validation

**API Endpoint:**
```javascript
// POST /api/v1/checkin
// Body: {
//   licensePlate: "ABC123",
//   vehicleType: "standard" // compact, standard, oversized
// }
// Response: {
//   success: true,
//   spotId: "F1-B2-S015",
//   location: { floor: 1, bay: 2, spot: 15 },
//   checkInTime: "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
//   message: "Vehicle checked in successfully"
// }
```

**Spot Assignment Algorithm:**
1. Filter spots by availability
2. Filter by vehicle type compatibility
3. Prefer lower floors (accessibility)
4. Prefer spots closer to entrance/elevator
5. Return first matching spot

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3 - Data models available
- [ ] Task 4 - Garage initialized
- [ ] Task 5 - Spot operations working

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-5 hours
- Parallel: false (conflicts with checkout)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Check-in endpoint functional
- [ ] Spot assignment algorithm working
- [ ] Duplicate prevention implemented
- [ ] Vehicle records created correctly
- [ ] Spot status updated atomically
- [ ] Validation and error handling complete
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Edge cases handled (no spots, invalid vehicle type)

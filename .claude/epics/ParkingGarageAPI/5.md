# Task: Spot Operations API

## Description
Implement the core spot management endpoints for listing, filtering, and updating parking spots. This includes getting all spots, filtering by availability or type, retrieving individual spot details, and updating spot status.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GET /api/v1/spots returns all spots with pagination
- [ ] GET /api/v1/spots?status=available filters by availability
- [ ] GET /api/v1/spots?type=compact filters by spot type
- [ ] GET /api/v1/spots/:id returns individual spot details
- [ ] PATCH /api/v1/spots/:id updates spot status/type
- [ ] Response includes spot counts by status
- [ ] Supports combined filters (status AND type)
- [ ] Proper 404 handling for non-existent spots

## Technical Details
- Implement efficient filtering using Map iteration
- Support pagination (limit/offset)
- Include metadata in responses (total count, available count)
- Atomic status updates to prevent race conditions

**Files to create/modify:**
- `src/routes/spots.js` - Spot route definitions
- `src/controllers/spotController.js` - Spot business logic
- `src/services/spotService.js` - Spot operations service
- `src/middleware/validation/spotValidation.js` - Input validation
- `src/utils/pagination.js` - Pagination helper

**API Endpoints:**
```javascript
// GET /api/v1/spots
// Query params: status, type, floor, bay, limit, offset
// Response: { 
//   spots: [...], 
//   metadata: { total, available, occupied },
//   pagination: { limit, offset, hasMore }
// }

// GET /api/v1/spots/:id
// Response: { spot details }

// PATCH /api/v1/spots/:id
// Body: { status: "occupied", type: "compact" }
// Response: { updated spot }
```

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 2 - Express server running
- [ ] Task 3 - Data models implemented

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3-4 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside Task 4)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All spot endpoints functional
- [ ] Filtering works correctly
- [ ] Pagination implemented
- [ ] Status updates are atomic
- [ ] Validation in place
- [ ] Error handling complete
- [ ] API tests written
- [ ] Performance acceptable (<50ms response)

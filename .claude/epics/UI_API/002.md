# Task 002: Environment Configuration

## Description

Add preset environments (dev/staging/prod) with saved URLs to improve the API testing experience. This task involves creating environment configuration options in the API testing interface, allowing users to quickly switch between different deployment environments without manually changing URLs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Environment dropdown with dev/staging/prod options
- [ ] Each environment has predefined base URL
- [ ] Current environment is clearly displayed
- [ ] URLs automatically update when switching environments
- [ ] Custom environment option for manual URL entry
- [ ] Environment selection persists across browser sessions
- [ ] Visual indication of active environment

## Technical Details

### Environment Configuration Structure
```javascript
const environments = {
  development: {
    name: 'Development',
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',
    description: 'Local development server'
  },
  staging: {
    name: 'Staging',
    baseUrl: 'https://staging-api.parkinggarage.com',
    description: 'Staging environment for testing'
  },
  production: {
    name: 'Production',
    baseUrl: 'https://api.parkinggarage.com',
    description: 'Live production environment'
  },
  custom: {
    name: 'Custom',
    baseUrl: '',
    description: 'Custom URL entry'
  }
};
```

### Implementation Requirements
- Add environment selector to API testing interface
- Implement localStorage for persistence
- Update all API request URLs based on selected environment
- Add visual styling to distinguish environments (colors/badges)
- Include environment validation (URL format checking)

### UI Components
- Environment dropdown/selector
- URL display field
- Environment status indicator
- Custom URL input field (when custom is selected)

## Dependencies

- None (can start immediately)

## Parallel Execution

- Can run in parallel with other tasks
- No blocking dependencies on other UI_API tasks

## Conflicts

- None identified

## Effort Estimate

**Story Points: 3**
- 1 hour: Design environment configuration structure
- 2 hours: Implement UI components and logic
- 1 hour: Add persistence and validation
- 1 hour: Testing and refinement

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Environment selector functional and accessible
- [ ] All preset environments work correctly
- [ ] Custom environment option allows manual URL entry
- [ ] Environment selection persists across sessions
- [ ] Visual feedback clearly shows active environment
- [ ] URL validation prevents invalid configurations
- [ ] All API requests use selected environment URL
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

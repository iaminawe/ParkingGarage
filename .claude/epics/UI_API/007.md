# Task 007: Deployment Setup

## Description

Configure the parking garage system for production deployment on GitHub Pages or static hosting platforms. This includes setting up build processes, environment configuration, CI/CD pipelines, and providing comprehensive deployment instructions for both development and production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GitHub Pages deployment configuration
- [ ] Alternative static hosting options (Netlify, Vercel)
- [ ] Build and optimization scripts
- [ ] Environment configuration management
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Domain configuration and HTTPS setup
- [ ] Monitoring and analytics integration
- [ ] Deployment rollback procedures

## Technical Details

### GitHub Pages Setup
- Configure repository for GitHub Pages deployment
- Set up custom domain (if applicable)
- Enable HTTPS and security headers
- Configure build and deployment workflows

### Build Process
- Minification and bundling of assets
- Image optimization and compression
- CSS and JavaScript optimization
- Cache busting for static assets
- Environment-specific configurations

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  test-and-deploy:
    - Run tests
    - Build production assets
    - Deploy to GitHub Pages
    - Run post-deployment validation
```

### Alternative Hosting Options
- **Netlify**: Configuration and deployment instructions
- **Vercel**: Setup and optimization for serverless functions
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Enterprise deployment option
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment setup

### Environment Configuration
- Development vs production settings
- API endpoint configuration
- Feature flags and toggles
- Security and authentication settings
- Monitoring and logging configuration

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Error tracking setup (Sentry or similar)
- Performance monitoring
- Usage analytics (privacy-compliant)
- Uptime monitoring
- Real-time alerting

## Dependencies

- **Task 006**: All testing must be complete before production deployment

## Effort Estimate

- **Time**: 10-14 hours
- **Complexity**: High
- **Risk**: Medium

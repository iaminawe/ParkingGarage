# Task 001: OpenAPI Spec Validation

## Description

Ensure the OpenAPI specification matches all current API endpoints and add missing checkout endpoints. This task involves auditing the current API implementation against the OpenAPI spec, identifying discrepancies, and adding the missing checkout functionality that was referenced but not implemented.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All existing API endpoints are accurately documented in the OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Missing checkout endpoints are added to both spec and implementation
- [ ] Request/response schemas match actual API behavior
- [ ] All HTTP status codes are properly documented
- [ ] Authentication requirements are correctly specified
- [ ] API spec validates without errors using OpenAPI tools
- [ ] All endpoint examples work correctly

## Technical Details

### Current State Analysis
- Review existing endpoints in `/src/routes/` directory
- Compare against current OpenAPI specification
- Identify gaps in checkout functionality

### Implementation Requirements
- Update OpenAPI spec file to include missing endpoints
- Implement missing checkout endpoints:
  - POST /api/checkout - Initialize checkout process
  - PUT /api/checkout/:id - Update checkout details
  - GET /api/checkout/:id - Get checkout status
- Ensure all schemas are accurate and complete
- Add proper error response documentation

### Validation Steps
- Use swagger-validator or similar tool to validate spec
- Test all documented endpoints against actual implementation
- Verify response formats match documented schemas

## Dependencies

- None (can start immediately)

## Parallel Execution

- Can run in parallel with other tasks
- No blocking dependencies on other UI_API tasks

## Conflicts

- None identified

## Effort Estimate

**Story Points: 5**
- 2 hours: API audit and gap analysis
- 3 hours: Implement missing checkout endpoints
- 2 hours: Update OpenAPI specification
- 1 hour: Validation and testing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] OpenAPI spec passes validation tools
- [ ] All existing endpoints documented accurately
- [ ] Checkout endpoints implemented and functional
- [ ] All endpoint examples tested and working
- [ ] Response schemas match actual API responses
- [ ] Documentation includes proper error handling
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

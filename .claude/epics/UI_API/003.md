# Task 003: Error Handling Enhancement

## Description

Improve error messages with troubleshooting steps and CORS guidance to enhance the developer experience when using the API testing interface. This task focuses on providing actionable error information that helps developers quickly identify and resolve common API issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Detailed error messages for common HTTP status codes
- [ ] CORS troubleshooting guidance for cross-origin issues
- [ ] Network error handling with retry suggestions
- [ ] Authentication error messages with clear next steps
- [ ] Validation error messages showing specific field issues
- [ ] Timeout handling with configuration options
- [ ] Error categorization (network, server, client, auth)
- [ ] Contextual help links for different error types

## Technical Details

### Error Categories and Messages

#### Network Errors
- Connection refused: "Cannot connect to server. Check if the API server is running."
- Timeout: "Request timed out. The server may be overloaded or unavailable."
- DNS errors: "Cannot resolve server address. Check your internet connection."

#### CORS Issues
- CORS blocked: "Cross-origin request blocked. Ensure CORS is configured on the API server."
- Preflight failed: "CORS preflight check failed. Verify allowed methods and headers."

#### Authentication Errors
- 401 Unauthorized: "Authentication required. Please provide valid credentials."
- 403 Forbidden: "Access denied. Your account may not have sufficient permissions."
- Token expired: "Authentication token has expired. Please refresh your credentials."

#### Server Errors
- 500 Internal Server Error: "Server encountered an error. This may be temporary - try again."
- 502/503/504: "Server temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few moments."

#### Client Errors
- 400 Bad Request: "Invalid request format. Check your request parameters and data."
- 404 Not Found: "Endpoint not found. Verify the URL and API version."
- 422 Validation Error: "Request validation failed. Check required fields and formats."

### Implementation Requirements
- Create error message mapping system
- Add error categorization logic
- Implement contextual help system
- Add retry mechanisms for transient errors
- Create troubleshooting guide modal/panel
- Add error logging for debugging

### User Experience Enhancements
- Color-coded error types (red=critical, yellow=warning, blue=info)
- Expandable error details
- Copy error details to clipboard functionality
- Error history/log for debugging sessions

## Dependencies

- None (can start immediately)

## Parallel Execution

- Can run in parallel with other tasks
- No blocking dependencies on other UI_API tasks

## Conflicts

- None identified

## Effort Estimate

**Story Points: 4**
- 1 hour: Design error categorization system
- 2 hours: Implement enhanced error handling logic
- 2 hours: Create user-friendly error messages and UI
- 1 hour: Add CORS troubleshooting guidance
- 1 hour: Testing and validation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All common error scenarios have helpful messages
- [ ] CORS issues include specific troubleshooting steps
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] Error categorization works correctly
- [ ] Retry functionality available for appropriate errors
- [ ] Error details can be copied for debugging
- [ ] Contextual help system provides relevant guidance
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

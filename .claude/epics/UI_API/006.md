# Task 006: Testing & Validation

## Description

Comprehensive testing and validation across multiple browsers, devices, and scenarios. This includes API contract validation, cross-browser compatibility testing, performance validation, and user acceptance testing to ensure the system works reliably in production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile device testing on iOS and Android
- [ ] API contract validation with automated tests
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] Accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- [ ] Security testing for common vulnerabilities
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent users
- [ ] User acceptance testing scenarios

## Technical Details

### Cross-Browser Testing
- **Chrome**: Latest stable version
- **Firefox**: Latest stable version
- **Safari**: Latest version (desktop and mobile)
- **Edge**: Latest version
- Test on both desktop and mobile versions

### API Contract Validation
- Validate all endpoint responses match OpenAPI specification
- Test error handling and status codes
- Verify request/response data types
- Test authentication and authorization
- Validate rate limiting behavior

### Performance Testing
- Measure page load times (<3 seconds)
- Test API response times (<500ms)
- Memory usage optimization
- Network efficiency testing
- Caching validation

### Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Focus indicators
- ARIA labels and semantics

### Security Testing
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- HTTPS enforcement

### Load Testing
- Test with 100 concurrent users
- Validate database performance under load
- Test API rate limiting
- Memory leak detection
- Error recovery testing

## Dependencies

- **Task 001**: API specification must be finalized
- **Task 002**: Frontend implementation must be complete
- **Task 003**: Backend implementation must be complete
- **Task 004**: UI polish must be complete for accurate testing

## Effort Estimate

- **Time**: 12-16 hours
- **Complexity**: High
- **Risk**: Medium

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All browsers show consistent behavior
- [ ] Mobile experience is fully functional
- [ ] API contracts are validated and documented
- [ ] Performance meets defined benchmarks
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities are addressed
- [ ] Load testing results are documented
- [ ] Test reports are generated and reviewed
- [ ] Critical bugs are fixed before sign-off

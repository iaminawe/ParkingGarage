# Task 004: UI/UX Polish

## Description

Enhance the user interface with polished interactions, loading states, and responsive design improvements. This task focuses on creating a professional, user-friendly experience with smooth animations, clear feedback, and optimal display across all device sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Loading spinners/indicators for all API calls
- [ ] Smooth hover effects and transitions on interactive elements
- [ ] Quick action buttons with visual feedback
- [ ] Responsive grid layout that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Error states with clear messaging and recovery options
- [ ] Success/confirmation messages for user actions
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support for accessibility
- [ ] Touch-friendly interface for mobile devices

## Technical Details

### Loading States
- Implement loading spinners during API calls
- Disable buttons during processing to prevent double-clicks
- Show skeleton loaders for data fetching

### Responsive Design
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Implement mobile-first design approach

# PRD: ParkingGarageAPI

## Executive Summary

The ParkingGarageAPI is a RESTful web service designed to manage parking garage operations efficiently. This API provides core functionality for tracking parking spot availability, managing vehicle check-ins/check-outs, and calculating parking fees. Built with Node.js/Express, it initially uses in-memory storage for rapid prototyping while maintaining an architecture that supports future database integration and multi-garage scaling.

The system addresses the critical need for automated parking management, reducing manual overhead and improving customer experience through real-time availability tracking and streamlined check-in/check-out processes.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Current parking garage management relies heavily on manual processes, legacy systems, or disconnected solutions that lead to:
- Inefficient space utilization due to lack of real-time visibility
- Long wait times at entry/exit points
- Revenue loss from untracked vehicles or billing errors
- Poor customer experience with no visibility into availability
- Inability to integrate with modern payment and reservation systems

### Why is this important now?
- Increasing urbanization demands more efficient use of limited parking space
- Customer expectations for digital, contactless experiences have accelerated
- Need for data-driven insights to optimize pricing and capacity
- Growing ecosystem of mobility apps requiring API integrations
- Transition to electric vehicles requiring specialized spot management

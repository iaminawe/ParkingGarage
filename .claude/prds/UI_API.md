# PRD: UI_API

## Executive Summary

The UI_API feature provides an interactive web-based interface for testing, exploring, and documenting the Parking Garage Management API. Built using Stoplight Elements, it offers developers and stakeholders a comprehensive tool to understand API capabilities, test endpoints in real-time, and validate integration scenarios without writing code. This solution accelerates API adoption, reduces integration errors, and serves as living documentation that stays synchronized with the API specification.

## Problem Statement

Currently, developers integrating with the Parking Garage API face several challenges:

- **Limited Visibility**: No easy way to explore available endpoints and their capabilities without reading raw documentation
- **Testing Friction**: Testing API endpoints requires external tools like Postman or writing custom scripts
- **Documentation Gaps**: Static documentation often becomes outdated and doesn't provide interactive examples
- **Onboarding Delays**: New developers need significant time to understand the API structure and test workflows
- **Integration Errors**: Lack of real-time testing leads to integration issues discovered late in development

These issues result in slower adoption, increased support burden, and higher integration costs for API consumers.

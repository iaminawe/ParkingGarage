# PRD: SQLite & Prisma ORM Integration

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the integration of SQLite database with Prisma ORM into the Parking Garage Management System, replacing the current in-memory storage (MemoryStore) with a persistent, type-safe database layer. This enhancement will provide data persistence across application restarts, improved data integrity through transactions, and better development experience with Prisma's auto-generated type-safe client.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- **Data Loss on Restart**: All parking session data, vehicle records, and payment information is lost when the application restarts
- **No Transaction Support**: Complex operations involving multiple entities lack ACID guarantees
- **Limited Scalability**: In-memory storage constrains the amount of data that can be managed
- **No Data History**: Unable to maintain audit trails or historical analytics
- **Testing Limitations**: Difficult to test data persistence and recovery scenarios

### Why Now?
- System is mature enough to require persistent storage
- Growing need for historical reporting and analytics
- Customer requirements for data retention and compliance
- Development team needs better tooling for database management

## User Stories

### As a Parking Garage Operator
- I want parking session data to persist across system restarts so that active sessions are not lost
- I want to view historical parking data so that I can analyze usage patterns
- I want reliable transaction processing so that payment records are always consistent

### As a System Administrator
- I want automated database backups so that data can be recovered in case of failure
- I want database migrations so that schema changes can be applied safely
- I want to monitor database performance so that I can optimize queries

### As a Developer
- I want type-safe database queries so that I catch errors at compile time
- I want automated schema generation so that database structure matches my models
- I want database seeding capabilities so that I can quickly set up test environments

### As a Customer
- I want my parking history preserved so that I can view past transactions
- I want my vehicle information saved so that I don't need to re-enter it
- I want reliable payment processing so that transactions are never lost

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Database Integration
- **FR1**: Replace MemoryStore with SQLite database for all data persistence
- **FR2**: Implement Prisma ORM for all database operations

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- **NFR1**: Database queries must complete within 100ms for single record operations
- **NFR2**: Bulk operations must handle 1000+ records efficiently
- **NFR3**: Database file size must not exceed 10GB for typical usage
- **NFR4**: Support concurrent access from multiple application instances

#### Reliability
- **NFR5**: Implement automatic database backups every 24 hours
- **NFR6**: Support point-in-time recovery
- **NFR7**: Handle database corruption gracefully

#### Security
- **NFR9**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- **NFR10**: Implement SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- **NFR11**: Add audit logging for all database modifications
- **NFR12**: Support database access control and permissions

#### Scalability
- **NFR13**: Support horizontal scaling through read replicas (future)
- **NFR14**: Implement database sharding strategy (future)
- **NFR15**: Support data archival for old records
- **NFR16**: Optimize indexes for query performance

#### Developer Experience
- **NFR17**: Provide TypeScript type definitions for all models
- **NFR18**: Include comprehensive migration documentation
- **NFR19**: Add database debugging tools
- **NFR20**: Support local development without external dependencies

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Zero data loss** during application restarts
- **100% test coverage** for repository layer
- **< 100ms response time** for 95% of database queries
- **< 5 second** database initialization time
- **> 99.9% availability** for database operations

### Qualitative Metrics
- Improved developer satisfaction with type-safe queries
- Reduced debugging time for data-related issues
- Enhanced confidence in data integrity
- Better system observability through query logging

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All existing tests pass with new database layer
- [ ] Migration script successfully converts existing data
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet or exceed requirements
- [ ] Documentation covers all migration scenarios
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must use SQLite for simplicity and portability
- Cannot break existing API contracts
- Must support Node.js 18+ environments
- Database file must be portable across platforms

### Resource Constraints
- Implementation timeline: 2-3 sprints
- Single developer for initial implementation
- Limited testing infrastructure for load testing

### Assumptions
- SQLite performance is sufficient for expected load
- Prisma ORM overhead is acceptable
- File system has sufficient space for database growth
- Application has write permissions to database directory

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly Not Included
- Migration to PostgreSQL or MySQL (future consideration)
- Real-time data synchronization
- Multi-tenant database isolation
- GraphQL API implementation
